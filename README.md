# These codes are written in Zemax programming language, also known as ZPL macros.
# ZPL is a relatively simple yet powerful language that allows long term storage of the optical design files
# ZPL allows easy sharing as the file can be simply just a .txt file which the receiver can convert to the lens file (.zmx) using OpticStudio
# Please note these files have been tested with a slightly older version (OpticStudio 2017). 
Please get in touch with me if you have trouble running them
