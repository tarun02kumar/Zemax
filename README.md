# These codes are written in Zemax programming language, also known as ZPL macros.
# ZPL is a relatively simple programming language that allows long-term storage of optical design files
# ZPL allows easy sharing as the file can simply be a .txt file which the receiver can convert to the lens file (.zmx) using OpticStudio
# Allows unlimited commenting unlike lens file (my reason for using zpl macros)
# Please note these files have been tested with OpticStudio 2024 so get in touch with me if you have trouble running them
