# These codes are written in Zemax programming language also commonly known as ZPL macros.
# ZPL is a relatively simple yet powerful language that allows long term storage of the optical design files
# Its fairly easy to share also as the file can be simply just a .txt file which reciever can convert to lens file (.zmx) 
# using OpticStudio
# Please note these file have been tested with a slightly older version (OpticStudio 2017) so may have trouble with newer version
# of OpticStudio. Zemax tends to upgrade macros rendering older one's obsolete. Please contact me if you have trouble running them
